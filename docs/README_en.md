Powered by [MaaFramework](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework)!

</div>

- 🎣 Auto Fishing
  - 🐟 Auto Sell Fish
  - 🪝 Auto Buy Bait
- 🥤 Auto Coffee Brewing
- 💰 Auto Extract Café Revenue

## ❓ FAQ

### 🤔 Can't find how to launch?
- Regular users should download the **release version**. Only clone the repo if you have development needs.

### 🤔 Fishing not working?
- Make sure the program is run as **administrator**
- Check that the game resolution is set to **1280×720**
- Make sure **Auto Fishing** is enabled
- Do not place the program in a **path containing Chinese characters**
- Try **disabling your antivirus** software

### 🤔 Pop-up in the bottom right says Mirror is not supported?
This is due to auto-update not being configured. It does not affect functionality — you can ignore it.

## 💡 Notes
- The game must run at **1280×720 resolution** in **windowed mode**
- The new fishing algorithm supports running at **120 FPS**
- Auto coffee brewing requires setting mouse input to **Seize** mode — this will temporarily take over your mouse *(a non-seize method is being tested and will be released in beta first)*
